Objective
To analyze structured and unstructured data independently to identify loan fraud, assess customer risk, and understand customer behavior. This case study focuses on the loan and transaction data of Cross River Bank, leveraging MySQL and MongoDB for a comprehensive analysis.
Problem Statement
Cross River Bank, a U.S.-based fi nancial institution, faces challenges in detecting fraudulent activities and assessing customer risk effectively. With an increasing volume of loans and transactions, traditional manual methods are insuffi cient. The bank requires an automated system to analyze both structured data (e.g., customer, loan, and transaction data) and unstructured data (e.g., customer feedback, behavior logs) to identify patterns of fraud, optimize lending policies, and improve customer satisfaction.
